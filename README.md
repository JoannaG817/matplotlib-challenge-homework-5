Capomulin and Ramicane were significantly better at reducing tumor size than Infubino and Ceftamin.

Mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane lived longer than those treated with any other drug.

Average tumor size was strongly correlated with average mouse weight.

The results of the study are consistent and there is only one outlier in the data set for the top drugs.Pymaceuticals Inc.
